            <h2>Stuttgard</h2>
              <p><span class="firstletter">T</span>he Stuttgart was a German hospital ship which sank during the first bombing of the naval port in Gdynia by the Western Allies, which took place in 1943 about 2 nautical miles from the port of Gdynia.  
                  </p>
                    <p>In 1953 the Commission found that the hull 80% destroyed because of the wear and tear of the machines due to their age and 10 years later it was determined to be 100%. Taking into account the cost of extraction and reconstruction, outdated type, low speed and lack of operational need, the Committee ruled that the wreck was not worth extracting and rebuilding. In view of the above, it was considered that the Stuttgart wreck should be regarded as a navigational obstacle and removed by pyrotechnic method. The pyrotechnic method was a method used for very damaged wrecks and for removing navigational obstacles. It consists of breaking the wreckage into parts with explosives and extracting them with cranes. The operation started in 1956. Unfortunately, they didn’t analyze this method when it came in terms of the environmental impact.  The result of removing parts of the ship was contamination of the seabed with fuel and wreckage from the Stuttgart. The shipwreck was found again in 1992. Stuttgart is at a depth of 21-23m. 
                  </p>
                  <img class="materialboxed responsive-img z-depth-4" width="100%" src="img/stuttgard-article.jpg" alt="">
                  <p>
                    The Gulf of Gdańsk area, where the shipwreck Stuttgart is located, is an area particularly vulnerable to marine pollution, including the waters of the Vistula River and as a result of atmospheric deposition. The wreck lies close to the port of Gdynia, which is one of the largest seaports in Poland. Therefore, it cannot be unequivocally concluded that the source of water and sediment pollution in this area is solely the unit under examination.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although it cannot be indisputable that only the shipwreck Stuttgart is a source of contamination of bottom sediments in the area of its deposition, it can be concluded from the results obtained that it has a significant contribution to the contamination of bottom sediments, particularly those of the Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons group and certain metals.
                    It seems obvious that in most cases there is a likelihood of leakage of petroleum substances. The problem of wrecks at the bottom of the waters is particularly important in the case of small tanks with a mid-continental position such as the Baltic Sea, where intensive hostilities happened.
                  </p>
                  <img class="materialboxed responsive-img z-depth-4 " width="100%" src="img/oil-sea.jpg" alt="">
                  <p>
                    In 1999 it was set that the contaminated area with heavy fuel flowing out of the Stuttgart wreck is about 25 000 sq.m. The estimated volume of contaminated ground is about 40 000 c.m. (c.a. 70 000 tons). In 2015 the contaminated area grew to 350 000 sq.m. and the estimated volume of contaminated ground was up to 320 000 c.m. (c.a. 400 000 tons).
                    In the area of the Stuttgart Wreck sediments do not comply with the cleanliness standards for dredged material determined in the Regulation of the Minister of Environment, dated 9th September 2002 (Journal of Laws No.165, item 1359) - samples indicate great contamination of the seabed with heavy fuel – some indicators were exceeded by 1000 or more times. In the area of the Stuttgart wreck samples of water comply with the cleanliness standards.
                    The environment’s state in the region of the Stuttgart wreck identified in November 2009 is equal to the status of a local ecological catastrophe.  The layer of mazout occurring at the point of contact of bottom sediment and the depths of the water created an azoic zone – devoid of macroscopic life.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In November 2009 the state of the environment identified on the basis of macrozoobenthos surveys in the area of the Stuttgart wreck poses a direct threat not only for biocenoses of the marine seabed, but directly and indirectly for the whole trophic chain of the ecosystem. At 2015 we get proof – it is not end - polluted area is not less than 15 times bigger than initially.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In places of sample collection for surveys there was an uncovering of contaminated substratum and a complete atrophy of living forms.
                    It is necessary to start immediate work aimed at developing a method of cleaning and re-cultivating the seabed in the area s/s Stuttgart wreck.

  <h2>FRANKEN</h2>
    <p>The Franken was attacked by Soviet aircraft in 1945, fire occurred and the fuselage cracked, which fell apart and now lays in pieces at the bottom of the Gulf of Gdańsk. The Stern and the midship of the vessels are located approx. 420 m from the bow. The longest fully preserved fragment of the ship is over 130m long.
                  Its located in the very center of the Gdańsk Bay and is extremely likely to pose an ecological threat. The potential leakage of fuel from the wreck may threaten the existence of protected areas and seriously damage the ecosystem of the entire Gdańsk Bay and the cleanliness of all surrounding beaches. Nature reserves, protected areas, and 200 nature sites are threatened with serious contamination. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tourism would be greatly affected because having to end the tourist season due to soiled beaches would cost the industry about 500 million PLN – that would be a big economical loss.
    </p>
    <p>
                  Based on the collected documents, it was found that there is an almost complete certainty that, at the time of sinking, the Franken’s tanks contained approximately 2,700 tons of fuel, not counting the marine fuel needed for her operation.
                   The amount of potential cargo can be initially estimated at around 3,000 tons.
                  The documentation collected during the expedition (photos, videos, measurements) show that 5 tanks (out of 13), which look secure, could hold 4,608 tons of various types of fuel.
    </p>
  <img class="materialboxed responsive-img z-depth-4 " width="100%" src="img/franken article.jpg" alt="">
<p>
                  The results of conducted research indicate fuel contamination in sediment samples collected found in the surrounding area of the Franken wreck. This is evidenced by very high values of mineral oil, PAHs, substances extracted from petroleum ether, phenols, and increased content of organic carbon.
                  The estimates of the amount of petroleum products should also take into account other products (oils, greases, heating oils, bilge waters), which could amount to 1,000 tons aboard the ship. These are located in the part of the wreck that is undamaged.
    </p>
    <p>
                  After 75 years of lying on the bottom of the Baltic Sea about 7 mm of steel has eroded, which means that the wreck is on the verge of collapsing under it’s own weight. Soon, this will cause the wreckage to collapse rapidly, which will result in an uncontrolled release of fuels, oils, and other environmental contaminants.
                  Some of the tanks were seriously damaged during the fighting and after sinking.
                  </p>

                  On the post side, under the bow superstructure, a huge fragment of the side is torn off. The tank is probably empty, but there is a high possibility that there is fuel still trapped in nooks, under the deck, in the corners of the frames and deck houses. It cannot be confirmed or denied whether there is heavy fuel at the bottom of the tank or light fuel accumulated under the closed top of the tank.
                  When deciding to clean the wreck of the residual fuel, we have to take into the account all the hazards that exist on it. One of them is the undefined state of the structure, which could be in danger of collapsing. The second is a large number of unidentified objects on board, among which may be unexploded artillery deployed on the wreckage (both in the warehouses and onboard – there are probably many objects like this around the wreck).
                  Working conditions for a cleaning company has to be very limited. Before the work begins, it will be necessary to conduct a wide search for the presence of unexploded artillery objects from the wreckage. This significantly increases the cost of cleaning works and increases the vigilance of divers or teams remotely operating vehicles in the vicinity, as any careless action may result in loss of life and cause uncontrolled spillage.

  <h2>Coimbra</h2>
    <p>
      The tanker Coimbra was hit by several torpedos and sank during World War II off the coast of Long Island in 1942.  It broke into three parts and is now resting on its starboard side with the bow inverted.
    </p>
    <p>
      At both torpedo impact points, the oil tanks are open to the sea and empty. Between the hull breaks, little can be concluded about the presence or absence of oil inside. The exterior of the hull is in excellent condition, with no apparent breaches. While open to the sea, the hatches now lie at the bottom of the tank since the ship lies on her starboard side. This effectively blocks the escape route for the lighter-than-water oil. It is difficult to ascertain the condition of the Coimbra’s internal tanks.
    </p>
     <img class="materialboxed responsive-img z-depth-4 " width="100%" src="img/coimbra.jpg" alt="">
    <p>
      The wreck has been described as an environmental disaster waiting to happen and estimates of remaining cargo oil left onboard the wreck have been as high as 1,470,000 gallons (46,292 tones) of lubrication oil, not including bunkers. The problem with those estimates, however, is that the studies are based on were written in early 1975. After so many decades of leaking, it is unlikely that this amount of oil remains in the wreck. Given the circumstances of the sinking and the violent nature of the torpedo attack, it is unlikely that any of the tanks on the Coimbra escaped without some form of damage and some release of oil, so the exact amount of remaining oil cannot be determined with any degree of certainty. 
    </p>
                  
    <p>
      Socio-economic resources in the areas potentially affected by a release from the Coimbra include very highly utilized recreational beaches from North Carolina to Massachusetts. A release could impact shipping lanes that run through the area of impact from New York east of Cape Cod, and into Narragansett Bay.
