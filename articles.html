  <h3>FRANKEN</h3>
    <p>The Franken was attacked by Soviet aircraft in 1945, fire occurred and the fuselage cracked, which fell apart and now lays in pieces at the bottom of the Gulf of Gdańsk. The Stern and the midship of the vessels are located approx. 420 m from the bow. The longest fully preserved fragment of the ship is over 130m long.
                  Its located in the very center of the Gdańsk Bay and is extremely likely to pose an ecological threat. The potential leakage of fuel from the wreck may threaten the existence of protected areas and seriously damage the ecosystem of the entire Gdańsk Bay and the cleanliness of all surrounding beaches. Nature reserves, protected areas, and 200 nature sites are threatened with serious contamination. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tourism would be greatly affected because having to end the tourist season due to soiled beaches would cost the industry about 500 million PLN – that would be a big economical loss.
    </p>
    <p>
                  Based on the collected documents, it was found that there is an almost complete certainty that, at the time of sinking, the Franken’s tanks contained approximately 2,700 tons of fuel, not counting the marine fuel needed for her operation.
                   The amount of potential cargo can be initially estimated at around 3,000 tons.
                  The documentation collected during the expedition (photos, videos, measurements) show that 5 tanks (out of 13), which look secure, could hold 4,608 tons of various types of fuel.
    </p>
  <img class="materialboxed responsive-img z-depth-4 " width="800" src="img/franken article.jpg" alt="">
<p>
                  The results of conducted research indicate fuel contamination in sediment samples collected found in the surrounding area of the Franken wreck. This is evidenced by very high values of mineral oil, PAHs, substances extracted from petroleum ether, phenols, and increased content of organic carbon.
                  The estimates of the amount of petroleum products should also take into account other products (oils, greases, heating oils, bilge waters), which could amount to 1,000 tons aboard the ship. These are located in the part of the wreck that is undamaged.
    </p>
    <p>
                  After 75 years of lying on the bottom of the Baltic Sea about 7 mm of steel has eroded, which means that the wreck is on the verge of collapsing under it’s own weight. Soon, this will cause the wreckage to collapse rapidly, which will result in an uncontrolled release of fuels, oils, and other environmental contaminants.
                  Some of the tanks were seriously damaged during the fighting and after sinking.

                  On the post side, under the bow superstructure, a huge fragment of the side is torn off. The tank is probably empty, but there is a high possibility that there is fuel still trapped in nooks, under the deck, in the corners of the frames and deck houses. It cannot be confirmed or denied whether there is heavy fuel at the bottom of the tank or light fuel accumulated under the closed top of the tank.
                  When deciding to clean the wreck of the residual fuel, we have to take into the account all the hazards that exist on it. One of them is the undefined state of the structure, which could be in danger of collapsing. The second is a large number of unidentified objects on board, among which may be unexploded artillery deployed on the wreckage (both in the warehouses and onboard – there are probably many objects like this around the wreck).
                  Working conditions for a cleaning company has to be very limited. Before the work begins, it will be necessary to conduct a wide search for the presence of unexploded artillery objects from the wreckage. This significantly increases the cost of cleaning works and increases the vigilance of divers or teams remotely operating vehicles in the vicinity, as any careless action may result in loss of life and cause uncontrolled spillage.
